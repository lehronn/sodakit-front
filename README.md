## instalation instruction
1. Choose version sodakit (front, react or back) and copy from github repositories.
2. In root catalog use `npm install` with terminal to install all dependencies
3. Edit package.json and gulpfile as You wish.
   - Remember, Pug task in Gulp is configurated to process only one file -> dev/html/index.pug, if You want, change it to all html catalog or create object/array of files if You need.
4. Use `gulp build` in terminal to run all gulp tasks to build without watching changes.
5. All is finished, You can work now.

## gulp instruction
All possibly command:
`gulp` for build task with watching changes, just build + watch task
`gulp html` for pug building and concatenation to html
`gulp css` for sass building
`gulp js` for js building with eslint, babel end sources map
`gulp imagemin` for image optimalizing
`gulp clean` for delete dist catalog
`gulp watch` for watch changes only, without deleting dist folder
`gulp build` to run all building proces without watching changes and with delete dist folder before building

Good to know #1: `gulp watch` processes changed files so before You use `gulp watch` You have to build project with `gulp build`.

Good to know #2: index.pug is site container for meta-tags, create structure, linking css and libs. File main.pug is content of site.

Good to know #3: If Your javascripts sources map do not load in chrome after run dev tools please click F5 key (refresh) after run F12 (dev tools) *OR* do not use uglify plugin in gulp.
